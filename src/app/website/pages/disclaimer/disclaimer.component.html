                <li>Investment policy: <br>

                    Codex on Althash is a software development organization that focuses on software solutions for the
                    AltHash Blockchain. Codex on Althash's mission is to advance community interests in the blockchain
                    through the implementation of smart contracts in high- utility applications. No ownership or equity
                    interest in Codex on Althash or HTMLCoin LLC has ever been publicly offered, nor have any equity or
                    security investments in any Codex on Althash Organizations ever been publicly solicited. The Codex
                    on Althash Organizations have never, and will never, publicly offer for sale an equity or ownership
                    interest in Codex on Althash, the HTMLCoin Foundation, nor any other businesses or entities
                    associated. Tokens used in Codex application builds are not security or equity interest in Codex on
                    Althash Organizations or any other business or organization. Individuals who purchase HTML or HRC20
                    tokens are not “investing” in the HTMLCoin Organizations. Trading any goods, services, assets, or
                    securities for HTML or HRC20 tokens on public exchanges does not in any way enrich or inure to the
                    benefit of Codex on Althash or HTMLCoin Organizations. Codex on Althash 'partners', which would be
                    using the AltHash Blockchain and/or HRC20 tokens may or may not be termed as securities based on
                    their use case. Codex on Althash nor HTMLCoin Foundation in no way takes any responsibility, and
                    strongly advise individuals to do independent research before trading for any tokens/coins and also
                    before using any apps that use these tokens/coins.</li>
                <li>Compliance with tax obligations: <br>

                    The users of the Website are solely responsible to determinate what, if any, taxes apply to their
                    HTMLCoin transactions. The owners of, or contributors to, the Website and applications made by Codex
                    on Althash are NOT responsible for determining the taxes that apply to HTMLCoin or HRC20
                    transactions.</li>
                <li>The Website does not store, send, or receive HTMLCoin nor HRC20 tokens. This is because HTMLCoin and
                    HRC20 tokens exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Althash blockchain
                    network. Any transfer of title in HTMLCoin/ HRC20 tokens occur within a decentralized network, and
                    not on the Website.</li>
