            If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from our Website and/or our service as a result of mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification (“Counter Notification”) to our Designated Copyright Agent pursuant to DMCA 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(2) and (3). To be an effective Counter Notification under the DMCA, your Counter Notification must include substantially the following:<br>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.</li>
                <li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which your address is located, or if your address is outside the United States, for any judicial district in which our Company is located.</li>
                <li>A statement that you will accept service of process from the party that filed the Notification or the party's agent.</li>
                <li>Your name, address and telephone number.</li>
                <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material in question was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</li>
                <li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
            </ol>
<br>
            
            You may submit your Counter Notification to our Designated Copyright Agent by fax, mail, or email as set forth above. <br>
            
             
            
            If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification meeting the requirements described above, we will restore your removed or disabled material after ten (10) business days but no later than fourteen (14) business days from the date we receive your Counter Notification, unless our Designated Copyright Agent first receives notice from the party filing the original Notification informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question. Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees. Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes perjury. <br><br>
